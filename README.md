# We Run Here

A mock social networking web app built for the running community. Users can choose an avatar, post/delete recent runs, and can comment/like posts. Each profile displays statistical data and personal bests which are calculated and updated after posting/deleting a time. Posts from others in the community are displayed in a Twitter-esque live feed on the user's home page.

I created this project in order to understand how to build and manage a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application. I taught myself the tools GraphQL and Apollo and used them to communicate with my back end and database written with NodeJS and MongoDB, respectively. It was my most ambitious project to date and I'm proud I was able to successfully implement all of the features.
